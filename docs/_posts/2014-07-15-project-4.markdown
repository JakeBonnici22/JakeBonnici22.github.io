<h2>Breast Cancer Classifier</h2>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>In this project, the BreastCancer data set is used.
The data set contains characteristics of the breast tissue samples which were collected from 699 women, using 
fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). In this procedure a thin needle is inserted into an area of abnormal appearing
breast tissue. The data of nine characteristics of the breast tissue were collected, most notably; Uniformity of the
cell, size and shape. These were measured on a scale of 1 to 10, lower values indicating healthier cells, whilst larger
values being malignant cells. In the following sections some explanatory analysis will be conducted, followed by
different methods of classifiers and their cross validation based on the test error.</p>

The initial data analysis involved the utilization of the pairs function, which enabled the examination of correlations
between each predictor variable and the resulting response variable. This analysis is crucial in understanding the
relationships and dependencies within the dataset. The outcomes of this analysis are depicted in Figure 1.
Upon observing Figure 1, it becomes evident that mitosis exhibits the least correlation when compared to the other
predictor variables. The correlation values of mitosis with all the other characteristics are below 0.5, indicating
a relatively weak relationship. On the other hand, cell size and shape display notable correlation values with the
remaining predictor variables, except for mitoses. These two variables exhibit strong correlations with multiple
characteristics, indicating their potential significance in predicting the response variable. The pairs function
provides valuable insights into the interplay between predictor variables and the response variable, shedding light on
the relative strengths of their associations. This knowledge allows for a more informed selection of variables for
further analysis and model building, ultimately enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of the classification process.

After evaluating the test errors of different classifiers, it was found that logistic regression exhibited the lowest
error rate of 1.005%. This outcome establishes logistic regression as the most effective and accurate classifier for the
given dataset. Logistic regression utilizes a subset of five predictor variables, namely Cl.thickness, Cell.shape,
Marg.adhesion, bare.nuclei, and Bl.cromatin. These specific variables have proven to be influential in accurately
predicting the response variable. On the other hand, the remaining predictor variables were found to have p-values
greater than the predetermined alpha value of 0.05. Consequently, these variables were deemed insignificant in
determining the response variable, and their inclusion in the model was considered unnecessary.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This detailed analysis highlights the superiority of logistic regression as the optimal classifier, leveraging a
carefully chosen set of predictor variables to achieve accurate predictions for the breast cancer dataset at hand.</p>
