<h2>Development and Comparison of Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Metastatic Disease in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma</h2>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSSC) is the most common metastasising cancer worldwide. Whilst the majority of these cancers are relatively low-risk and easily treated, a proportion develop aggressive forms associated with high-rates of cancer progression and subsequent poor outcomes. Remarkably, there is no consensus definition of high-risk cSCC. We have developed a tabular dataset of over 7,000 patients which includes demographic and clinicopathological features. The aim of this project is to establish the accuracy of several machine learning algorithms in predicting and identifying cSCC at high risk of nodal and distant metastasis.
