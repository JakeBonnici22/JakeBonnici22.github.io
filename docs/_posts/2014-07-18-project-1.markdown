<h2>Electromagnetic Phantoms for Medical Applications</h2>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In the biomedical research medical phantoms are used extensively. There are two main
types of medical phantoms; calibration and anthropomorphic. Both phantoms mimic real
human tissue to ensure that methods for imaging the human body work correctly and
realistically. Medical phantoms provide for more consistent values when compared to
utilising living subjects or cadavers. Additionally, it eliminates the risks of working on
living subjects. This study investigates Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) as a host solution with different
percentages of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in liquid, gel and solid phantoms. The
dielectric properties were measured in a frequency range of 400 MHz to 14 GHz for each
sample. The dielectric properties of a liver emulating liquid solution were measured at
incremental steps of 5 ◦ C between a temperature range of 19.4 to 70 ◦ C. Additionally,
a phantom constructed for the use of microwave hyperthermia and ablation requires
solidification of the liquid solution. Therefore, 4 different solidifying agents; Agar,
gelatin, cornstarch and Xanthan gum were investigated in this study. Additionally, different
methods for solidification were investigated using techniques involving heating, cooling,
mixing and ultrasonic vibrations. Finally, a tensometer measured the different levels of
solidification for each agent by using different percentages of the agents. This study shows
that BSA would not be suitable candidate to construct temperature dependent phantoms
for radiowave/microwave hyperthermia or ablation applications, over long periods of time.
Additionally, solidification of the phantoms did solve the problem of convection currents,
whilst also creating opaque solutions.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The aim of this study was to investigate possible ingredients for the construction of
anthropomorphic temperature dependent phantoms by measuring the dielectric properties
and toughness. However, temperature dependent phantoms also need to be in solid or semisolid
form, as convectional currents in liquids will not allow the formation of hot spots
and instead a more uniform heating across the liquid will be observed. Initially, a liquid
phantom developed by the EMRG and reported in, based on PBS as the physiological
saline host solution to host BSA was investigated. PBS is a water based buffer that
maintains constant pH levels and is an isotonic solution consisting of Sodium Chloride,
Sodium Hydrogen Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Potassium Hydrogen Phosphate.

<h3>Dielectric properties of a 30P solution as a Function of Temperature</h3>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The dielectric properties of a liver phantom (30P) as a function of temperature was also
studied. Measurements were conducted between 19.4 ◦ C and 70 ◦ C at intervals of
5 ◦ C. In Figure 1 and 2, the dielectric constant and dielectric loss as a function of
frequency are presented for the different temperatures. The dielectric constant decreased
at low frequencies as the temperature was increased from room temperature to 70 ◦ C.
The 35 ◦ C dashed line in blue, is considered as an experimental outlier because of its
misplacement when compared to the decreasing trend of the dielectric constant and this
might be attributed to a possible air bubble at the tip of the probe. Up to 60 ◦ C, the
dielectric constant decreased with increasing temperature. At 55 ◦ C, it was visible that
the denaturing process had commenced, with the sample gradually
losing its transparency however the dielectric constant still continued to decrease with
temperature until the measured 60 ◦ C. Afterwards, the sample completely solidified and
reached an opaque state. At this point the dielectric constant increased consecutively when
increasing the temperature, for both the 60 and 70 ◦ C, respectively.
Figure 2, shows an increase in dielectric loss when the temperature was increased for low
frequency values. On the other hand, at high frequencies, the dielectric loss decreased
with increasing temperatures. This might occur, since at around 3 GHz the ions oscillate
at a rapid rate that the net ionic motion along a particular direction is less when compared
with a static or low frequency field.</p>

<h3>Penetration Tests on Different Solidifying Agents</h3>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>      
Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6, describe the force against the displacement for distinct solidifying
agents mixed with 0P at a concentration of 10 %, separately. The penetration test
resulted in the force required to break the surface tension of the tested material. This was
obtained from the first peak of Figures 3, 4 and 6, corresponding to agar, cornstarch
and gelatin. On the other hand, Figure 3, shows that Xanthan gum behaved in a similar
manner as that of a polymer structures, where the force seemed to increase continuously
with displacement. Additionally, the work done until the surface tension
broke, except for the Xanthan gum. This was obtained by computing the area under the
curve in Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6. Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6, were previously smoothened
using 𝑃𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑛‘𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑦.𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙.𝑙 𝑓 𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑟 along the force dimension, to remove excessive noise
from the data. The standard error was calculated at each displacement value for the 3
repeated experiments. Figures 4 and 6, show have an average standard error of ±4.04 N
and ±0.17 N, respectively. The uncertainties of Figures 4 and 6, increase at larger penetration
depths, this might be due to the chaotic nature of fluid dynamics and the difficulty to
create perfectly identical solutions. Furthermore, Figure 3, has an average standard error
of ±0.34 N. It was observed that for the Xanthan gum, the standard error increased as the
values for the force and displacement increased. This might indicate that the values of the
3 separate solutions increase in their structural variation when increasing the penetration
depth inside the solution. This might have occured due to some inhomogeneity between
the solutions. Conversely, gelatin has an average standard error of ±2.35 N, describing a
constant method of mixing and dissolving of the gelatin across all solutions. Additionally,
since the gelatin was stored and used at a temperature of 4.01 ◦ C, the gelatinous phantom
might have a higher level of solidification than the other solutions. This would explain the
relatively high values for the force and work done.

<h3>PBS solution mixed with 10%of Agar, Xanthan Gum, Cornstarch and Gelatin</h3>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Figures 7 and 8, represent the dielectric constant and dielectric loss as a function of
frequency of a 0P solution mixed with 10%of the different solidifying agents, respectively.
The agar, Xanthan gum, and cornstarch were measured at room temperatures. The gelatin
was measured at a temperature of 4.09 ◦ C, since the solution was stored in a refrigerator.
Among the solutions kept at room temperature, cornstarch was the one with the highest
dielectric constant across the frequency range, followed by agar and Xanthan gum. The
gelatin has the highest overall dielectric constant at low frequencies, however sharply 
declines to obtain the lowest values of the dielectric constant. 
Additionally, Figure 7, describes agar and gelatin having the highest and lowest dielectric
loss at low frequencies, respectively. Low temperatures within the gelatin solution implies
lower dielectric loss at low frequencies. This might be due the atoms having lower energies,
compared to the solutions at higher temperatures, therefore, the orientational polarisation
process will be reluctant to rotate at low frequencies.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This project focused on dielectric properties of a PBS solution mixed with BSA and
various solidifying agents and a penetration test on the solutions that were produced, in
order to identify possible ingredients for temperature dependent medical phantoms, which
are useful for microwave frequency hyperthermia and ablation procedures.
<ol style='text-align: justify;'>
  <li>The PBS samples were produced and the dielectric properties were measured.</li>
  <li>A 30P solution was produced, and the dielectric properties were measured from a temperature range starting from room temperature up to 70°C.</li>
  <li>The dielectric properties were measured for PBS mixed with different percentages of BSA and Xanthan gum.</li>
  <li>Lastly, the dielectric properties for 10% of the solidifying agents mixed with 0P were measured, and a penetration test was conducted on each respective solution.</li>
</ol>
were measured and a penetration test was conducted on each respective solution.
This study shows that for future works for microwave hyperthermia and ablation, BSA
might provide a suitable temperature dependent mimic similar to that of biological tissue,
however some comparisons to real life biological liver tissue is still required. When using
microwave hyperthermia techniques that reach temperatures up to 45 ◦C, the 30P solution
was already starting to denature and changing its structure, in a similar manner to that
of liver tissue. The solidifying agent that least effected the dielectric properties were
cornstarch at low frequencies and Xanthan gum and agar at high frequencies. Additionally,the solidification methods sufficiently reduced the hot spots that were introduced in the
liquid phantoms due to convection currents.
The largest limitations of this study were some slight inhomogeneities between identical
solidified solutions. Modification to this study would include, the use of a rheometer in
order to better understand and compare different viscosities brought by different solidifying
agents and a vacuum system in order to omit any trapped air.
</p>


<h3>Future Work</h3>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
For future studies, a rheometer might bring clearer insights on the viscosities of the
solutions, since it measures the behaviour of liquid flow in response to applied forces, i.e.
resistance to flow. This can be used for different solutions with different textures and draw
out a comparison between them. Additionally, to remove bubbles in a more effective way,
a centrifuge or vacuum system might produce more homogeneous results. Furthermore,
other solidifying agents such as, carrageenan and furcellaran, galactomannans and pectins
can be used to identify different possibilities for solidifying agents. Some light scattering
techniques in order to quantify the levels of homogeneity of the solutions and constructing
transparent phantoms that provide visual identification of tissue necrosis zones, which
would be useful for hyperthermic therapies. Lastly, it would be interesting to incorporate
3D printing techniques in order to create anatomically precise containers by using STL
files obtained from MRI scans.
